# NextJS starter boilerplate

Bootstrap a developer-friendly NextJS app configured with:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Linting, typechecking and formatting on by default using [`husky`](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for commit hooks
- Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [`react-testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## About this boilerplate

I stitched together the blog and typescript starters from vercel examples. Added few things like a responsive grid layout -see `styles/global.css`- with a header nav (programatically generated and also editable), pagination, few placeholder pages, among other things.

## Customize

Edit `lib/siteConfig.ts` to change brand, SEO, nav and footer menu items, etc.

There are a few example placeholder pages: About, Works, Privacy... feel free to change them as you see fit.

## More examples and boilerplates

Check [Vercel repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples) for an insane amount of examples and starters.
